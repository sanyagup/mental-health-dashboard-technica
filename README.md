Statement of the problem: Because hackers are very invested on their projects, having a break time to time is important for mental health. Without breaks the hackers can get burned out and loose track of their project. To address this problem we want to create a Mental Health / Self-Care Station: A digital wellness corner with stretch break guides, journaling prompts, breathing exercises, playlists, and more.

Solution/Topic: Implement a dashboard containing mini mental health activities

Description: This tool offers easily accessible mental health support through features like stretch break guides, journaling prompts, guided breathing, and mood tracking. By encouraging small, consistent self-care actions such as listening to calming music or getting random gentle reminders, it helps reduce stress, improve focus, and boost emotional awareness for the hackers without the need for app downloads or long commitments.
